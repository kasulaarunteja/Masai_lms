Assignment - Create LMS

You are using Masai LMS quite extensively. Let’s see if you can build important features of Masai LMS. 
Components -

DAY 1 - Project Submission & UI : 

Setup the project, Deploy on heroku and Submit git & heroku links in tracker sheet.

Both for UI & features, you need to Work on following routes of Masai LMS:

1. https://course.masaischool.com/login ( Setup authentication using firebase )
2.https://course.masaischool.com/lectures
3. https://course.masaischool.com/assignments
4. https://course.masaischool.com/admin ( explained in Day 2 below )





DAY 2 - Setup Backend & Authentication : 

Connect a Mongodb database with a Node.js server to perform CRUD operations.

Create following api’s : 

/lectures - list of all upcoming lectures
/assignments - list of all upcoming assignments

Add relevant details for each lecture and assignment. You can refer to Masai LMS to see what kind of data each lecture and assignment has. 


DAY 3 - Create Admin Page.



Create an admin page ( feel free to create your own UI for this page ) and add following features:
Post a new lecture
Post a new assignment

Both lecture & assignment should be added to MongoDB database via API routes mentioned in Day 1. 

Admin will use https://course.masaischool.com/login  to login just like other users.
Check the ip address of admin as well, allow successful signin only if ip address is from india.




DAY 4 - Final Touch Up & Bug Fixes.



For your reference : Refer to Masai LMS UI and how functionalities should be.


Expectations -

This is a basic full stack CRUD app. Since UI is simple, it is expected that you create pixel perfect UI along with functionalities mentioned above.

Make sure you follow proper git hygiene.

Submit Github link and Netilfy deployed link on day 1 itself in Tracker sheet.
Google drive link of a 1 min video explaining progress of your project daily.
